MIME type detector.

Ever seen "application/octet-stream" or "text/plain" or "text/html"? Those are
called MIME types. ("MIME" stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions.)

If your Java program has Files and needs to figure out MIME types, this
library will help.

Just do this:

    import org.overviewproject.mime_types.MimeTypeDetector
    
    ...
    
    String mimeType = MimeTypeDetector.detect("foo.txt"); // "text/plain"

You need two things to detect a file's type:

1. The file's name
2. The first few bytes of the file's content

You can get away with using just one or the other, but the results will be
iffy. So give both.

No library can figure out MIME types perfectly. But there's a standard, called
shared-mime-info, and this library follows it to the letter.

Big thanks to Medsea Business Solutions S.L. for most of this code. I merely
adjusted the API. (The original project at http://sourceforge.net/p/mime-util/
seems to be dead.)
