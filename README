MIME type detector.

Ever seen "application/octet-stream" or "text/plain" or "text/html"? Those are
called MIME types. ("MIME" stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions.)

If your Java program has Files and needs to figure out MIME types, this
library will help.

Just do this:

    import org.overviewproject.mime_types.MimeTypeDetector
    
    // ...
    
    File file = new File("foo.txt")
    String mimeType = MimeTypeDetector.detectMimeType(file); // "text/plain"

    // ... or ...

    InputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream("words".getBytes("utf-8"))
    String mimeType = MimeTypeDetector.detectMimeType("filename", stream); // "text/plain"

No library can figure out MIME types perfectly. But there's a standard, called
shared-mime-info. This library follows it to the letter.

You need two things to detect a file's type:

1. The file's name
2. The first few bytes of the file's content

The bytes aren't always needed; for speed, you can pass a callback instead of
the actual bytes, and this library will only invoke the callback when it's
absolutely necessary. There's an async version, too.

Big thanks to Medsea Business Solutions S.L. for most of this code. I merely
adjusted the API. (The original project at http://sourceforge.net/p/mime-util/
seems to be dead.)
